Part A shows the abdominopelvic regions. These regions divide the abdomen into nine squares. The upper right square is the right hypochondriac region and contains the base of the right ribs.

The epigastric region is the upper central square and contains the bottom edge of the liver as well as the upper areas of the stomach.
